# Skill Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific domains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### What Skills Provide
* **Specialized workflows** - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
* **Tool integrations** - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
* **Domain expertise** - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
* **Bundled resources** - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key
The context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.

Default assumption: Claude is already very smart. Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does Claude really need this explanation?" and "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom
Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

* **High freedom (text-based instructions):** Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.
* **Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters):** Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.
* **Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters):** Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.

Think of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).

## Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

### SKILL.md (required)
Every SKILL.md consists of:
* **Frontmatter (YAML):** Contains name and description fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used.
* **Body (Markdown):** Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers.

### Bundled Resources (optional)
#### Scripts (scripts/)
Executable code for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.
#### References (references/)
Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed. Best practice: if files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md.
#### Assets (assets/)
Files not intended to be loaded into context, but used within the output (templates, images, etc.).

## Progressive Disclosure Design Principle
Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words).
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words).
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude.

Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate reference files when approaching this limit.

## Skill Creation Process

1. **Understand the skill with concrete examples**: Identify triggers and desired functionality.
2. **Plan reusable skill contents**: Identify scripts, references, and assets.
3. **Initialize the skill**: Run `scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>`.
4. **Edit the skill**: Implement resources and write SKILL.md using imperative form. 
    * Consult `references/workflows.md` and `references/output-patterns.md`.
5. **Package the skill**: Run `scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>`. This validates and creates a `.skill` file.
6. **Iterate**: Refine based on real performance.
